-- Albert Einstein, 1947</blockquote><p>despite einstein's meta-physical objections, the current models of physics, and particularly of quantum theory, are based on the idea that nature does indeed involve random processes.</p><p>as much as randomness is abundant, its hard to implement this randomness in programs.</p><p>being able to simulate random behavior is necessary, for example, if you want to write a computer game that involves flipping a coin or rolling a die, but is also useful in more practical contexts, as well. programs that simulate such random events are called <b>non-deterministic</b> programs.</p><p>getting a computer to behave in a random way involves a certain amount of complexity.</p><h2>random numbers vs pseudo-random numbers</h2><p>from a theoretical perspective, a number is random if there is no way to determine in advance what value it will have among a set of equally probable possibilities.</p><p>as i described earlier, the idea of random numbers makes intuitive sense but it is a difficult notion to represent inside a computer. but why? well, computers operate by following a sequence of instructions in memory and therefore function in deterministic mode.</p><p>now you might be wondering how is it possible to generate unpredictable results by following a deterministic set of rules? after all if a number is the result of a deterministic process, any user should be able to work through that same set of rules and anticipate the computer's response, right?</p><p>yet computers do in fact use a deterministic procedure to generate what we call "random" numbers. this strategy somehow works because, even though the user could, in theory, follow the same set of rules and anticipate the computer's response, no one actually bothers to do so (lol lmao even).</p><p><img src="/images/reddit-meme.jpg" alt="random number"></img></p><p>turns out in most practical applications, it doesn't matter if the numbers are truly random; all that matters is that the number <i>appears</i> to be random.</p><p>for numbers to appear random, they should:</p><ol><li>behave like random numbers from a statistical point of view</li><li>be sufficiently difficult to predict in advance that no user would bother</li></ol><p>"random" numbers generated by an algorithmic process inside the computer are referred to as <b>pseudo-random numbers</b> to mention the fact that no truly random activity is involved.</p><p>let us see how is this implemented in c/c++</p><h2>pseudorandom numbers in the standard libraries</h2><p>the <code>&ltcstdlib&gt</code> library exports a low level function called <code>rand</code> that produces pseudo-random numbers.</p><p>prototype for <code>rand</code> is</p><pre><code>int rand();</code></pre><p>each call to <code>rand</code> produces a different value that is difficult for users to predict and therefore appear to be random. the result of <code>rand</code> is guaranteed to be non-negative and no larger than the constant <code>RAND_MAX</code> from <code>&ltcstdlib&gt</code>, so each call to <code>rand</code> returns a <code>int</code> between $0$ and <code>RAND_MAX</code>, inclusive.</p><p>let us print the result of calling <code>rand</code> 10 times to check the vibe</p><pre><code>#include &ltcstdlib&gt
#include &ltiomanip&gt
#include &ltiostream&gt
using namespace std;

int main(void) {
  cout &lt&lt "RAND_MAX: " &lt&lt RAND_MAX &lt&lt endl;
  for (size_t i = 0; i &lt 10; i++) {
    cout &lt&lt setw(10) &lt&lt rand() &lt&lt endl;
  }
  return 0;
}</code></pre><p>output:</p><pre><code>RAND_MAX: 2147483647

// 1. generate a real number d in the range [0...1)
// 2. scale the number to the range [0...n) where n is the number of values
// 3. translate the number so that the range starts at appropriate value
// 4. convert the result to the next lower integer with floor()

int randomInteger(int low, int high) {
  // normalising:
  double d = rand() / (double(RAND_MAX) + 1);
  // scaling:
  double s = d * (double(high) - low + 1);
  // translation and converting to int:
  return int(floor(low + s));
}</code></pre><p>similarly function for generating random real numbers could be implemented</p><pre><code>double randomReal(double low, double high) {
  double d = rand() / (double(RAND_MAX) + 1);
  double s = d * (high - low + 1);
  return low + s;
}</code></pre><p>but there is still one issue remaining, no matter how many times you will call the function it'll return the same value and that is not random by any means. at first, it may be hard to understand why a function that is supposed to return a random number always returns the same sequence of values. after all, deterministic behavior of this sort seems to run counter to the whole idea of randomness. there is, however, a good reason for this behavior: programs that behave <i>deterministically</i> are easier to debug</p><p>at the same time, it also has to be possible to use <code>rand</code> so that it doesn’t always deliver the same results. to understand how to implement this behavior, it helps to understand how <code>rand</code> works internally. the <code>rand</code> function generates each new random value by applying a set of mathematical calculations to the last value it produced.</p><p>because we don’t know what those calculations are, it is best to think of the entire operation as a <i>black box</i> where old numbers go in on one side and new pseudorandom numbers pop out on the other. (i could make another post diving deep in this topic, if you some of y'all are interested in this)</p><p>let's use our previous example where we printed 10 seemingly random numbers</p><pre><code>RAND_MAX: 2147483647
1804289383
 846930886
1681692777
1714636915

 424238335
 719885386
1649760492
 596516649
1189641421</code></pre><p>since the first call to rand produces the value $1804289383$ the second call to <code>rand</code> corresponds to putting $1804289383$ into one end of the black box and having $846930886$ pop out on the other side:</p><p><img src="/images/blackbox1.png" alt="black box 1"></img></p><p>on the next call to <code>rand</code> the implementation puts $846930886$ into the black box, which returns $1681692777$:</p><p><img src="/images/blackbox2.png" alt="blackbox2"></img></p><p>this same process is repeated on each call to <code>rand</code>. the computation inside the black box is designed so that:</p><ol><li>numbers are uniformly distributed over the legal range</li><li>sequence goes on for a long time before it begins to repeat</li></ol><p>but what about the first call to <code>rand</code> the one that returns $1804289383$? the implementation must have a starting point. there must be an integer $s0$ that goes into the black box and produces $1804289383$:</p><p><img src="/images/blackbox3.png" alt="black box 3"></img></p><p>this initial value that is used to get the entire process started is called the <i>seed</i> for the random number generator.</p><p>in the <code>&ltcstdlib&gt</code> library, you can set that <i>seed</i> explicitly by calling <code>srand(seed)</code>.</p><p>as we know from the multiple runs of the previous program, the C++ library sets the initial <i>seed</i> to a constant value every time a program is started, which is why <code>rand</code> always generates the same sequence of values.</p><p>to implement this change, the functions <code>randomInteger</code> and <code>randomReal</code> must first check to see whether the random number <i>seed</i> has already been initialized and, if not, set it to some starting value that would be difficult for users to predict, which is usually taken from the value of the system clock.</p><p>now you might be thinking : "senpai, but why the value from the system clock? why not add my body count? its unique :3" so the reason is we need a different value every time our program runs and guess what changes everytime? "time" - you guessed it right!!</p><p>in C++, we can retrieve the current value of the system clock by calling the function <code>time</code> and then converting the result to an integer. this allows you to write the following statement, which has the effect of initializing the pseudorandom number generator to an unpredictable point:</p><pre><code>srand(int(time(NULL)));</code></pre><p>although it requires only a single line, the operation to set the random seed to an unpredictable value based on the system clock is quite obscure.</p><p>to ensure that the initialization code doesn’t get executed every time, you need a <code>bool</code> flag to record whether that initialization has been performed.</p><p>we'll use this function to initialize a random seed before initializing any of our functions in the library:</p><pre><code>void initRandomSeed() {
  static bool initialized = false;
  if (!initialized) {
    srand(int(time(NULL)));
    initialized = true;
  }
}</code></pre><p>now we need to use this function in <code>randomInteger</code> and <code>randomReal</code></p><p>updated functions definitions:</p><pre><code>int randomInteger(int low, int high) {
  initRandomSeed();
  double d = rand() / (double(RAND_MAX) + 1);
  double s = d * (double(high) - low + 1);
  return int(floor(low + s));
}

double randomReal(double low, double high) {
  initRandomSeed();
  double d = rand() / (double(RAND_MAX) + 1);
  double s = d * (high - low + 1);
  return low + s;
}</code></pre><p>and our random number generating library is complete now, i hope you understood the underlying basics :)</p><p><img src="/images/lain-meme.jpeg" alt="random num gen meme"></img></p><h3>monte carlo integration</h3><p>let us solve a interesting problem that involves randomness to approximate the value of $\pi$. sounds interesting?</p><p>imagine that you have a dartboard hanging on your wall that consists of a circle painted on a square backdrop, as in the following diagram:</p><p><img src="/images/square.png" alt="square"></img></p><p>what happens if you throw a whole bunch of darts completely randomly, ignoring any darts that miss the board altogether? some of the darts will fall inside the gray circle, but some will be outside the circle in the white corners of the square. if the throws are random, the ratio of the number of darts landing inside the circle to the total number of darts hitting the square should be approximately equal to the ratio between the two areas. the ratio of the areas is independent of the actual size of the dartboard, as illustrated by the formula:</p><p>$\frac{\text{darts falling inside the circle}}{\text{darts falling inside the square}}$ = $\frac{\text{area inside the circle}}{\text{area inside the square}}$ = $\frac{\pi r^2}{4r^2}$ = $\frac{\pi}{4}$</p><p>to simulate this process in a program, imagine that the dart board is drawn on the standard cartesian coordinate plane with its center at the origin and a radius of 1 unit. the process of throwing a dart randomly at the square can be modeled by generating two random numbers, x and y, each of which lies between –1 and +1. this (x, y) point always lies somewhere inside the square. the point (x, y) lies inside the circle if</p><p>$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} &lt 1$</p><p>this condition, however, can be simplified considerably by squaring each side of the inequality, which yields the following more efficient test:</p><p>$x^2 + y^2 &lt 1$</p><p>if you perform this simulation many times and compute what fraction of the darts fall inside the circle, the result will be an approximation of $\frac{\pi}{4}$.</p><p>solution:</p><p>we will simulate throwing $100,000$ darts and will use our random number library that we designed to approximate the value of $\pi$</p><pre><code>#include "random.h"
#include &ltcmath&gt
#include &ltiostream&gt
using namespace std;
const int LIMIT = 100000;

int main(void) {
  double x, y;
  int sum_circle = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt LIMIT; i++) {
    x = randomReal(-1, 1);
    y = randomReal(-1, 1);
    if (x*x + y*y &lt 1) {
      sum_circle++;
    }
  }

  cout &lt&lt sum_circle / double(LIMIT) &lt&lt endl;
  cout &lt&lt M_PI / 4 &lt&lt endl; // M_PI stores the value of PI
  return 0;
}</code></pre><p>output:</p><pre><code>0.78468
0.785398</code></pre><p>see how close we are to the original value just with randomness? isn't that amazing?</p><p>the strategy used in this problem is not particularly accurate, even though it occasionally proves useful as an approximation technique. in mathematics, this technique is called monte carlo integration, after the capital city of monaco, famous for its casinos.</p><p>maybe by this blog i could show you how randomness is everywhere in our nature and how can we generate pseudo-random numbers. and to counter the quote by Albert Einstein i'll post another quote of a famous physicist.</p><blockquote><i>Not only that God does play dice, but that He sometimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.</i>
