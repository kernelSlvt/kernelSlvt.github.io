hallo there!! im a second year cs undergrad. i am interested in **deep learning**, **systems programming** and **high performance computing**. i post about my work and interests here.

i'm trying to discover more interesting things out there and spend time learning and reflecting on them. witnessing the emerging effects of a dozen matmuls is incredible to me. long term goal here is to understand in order to build intelligence.

open to **new roles** in the above fields (and _more!!_)

c++ // rust // python // ocaml // ts // golang // haskell
